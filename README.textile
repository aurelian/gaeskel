h2. GAE Skel

A lame skeleton for GAE. Lame, just because it's not complete.

h3. What's in?

 * "Routes":http://routes.groovie.org/index.html (BSD): a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for mapping URL's to Controllers/Actions and generating URL's.
 * "Jinja2":http://jinja.pocoo.org/2/ (BSD): a small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine written in pure python.
 * GAESkel (Apache2.0) - glue to assamble Routes and Jinja2 in GAE Environment.
 * "Textile":http://loopcore.com/python-textile/ (BSD): a Humane Web Text Generator

WSGI implementation is based on "Match Webapp URL's Using Routes":http://appengine-cookbook.appspot.com/recipe/match-webapp-urls-using-routes/.
